# Lizzy

Lizzy is a Java 25 desktop task manager for todos, deadlines, events, and
tasks with flexible completion periods. Its JavaFX conversation interface
offers concise command guidance, persistent storage, schedule lookup, and a
warm, lightly witty personality.

See the [Lizzy User Guide](docs/README.md) for installation and every user
command.

## Development setup

1. Install JDK 25 and open this repository in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Set the project SDK to JDK 25 and the language level to **SDK default**.
3. Run `./gradlew run` to start the graphical interface.

The console interface remains available through `lizzy.Lizzy#main`.

## Build and test

Create the cross-platform fat JAR with:

```sh
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

The output is `build/libs/lizzy.jar`. Run the full automated checks with:

```sh
./gradlew check
```

## Acknowledgements

### AI assistance

Yanrong Wang used OpenAI Codex with GPT-5.6 Terra and GPT-5.6 Sol
extensively as a learning aid during development. It provided explanations,
design feedback, and code suggestions for selected Java, JavaFX, testing,
documentation, Git, and user-interface work. This included task parsing and
validation, error handling, automated tests, the JavaFX conversation
interface, the User Guide, and product screenshots. The author reviewed,
adapted, integrated, and tested the resulting changes.

OpenAI image generation was also used to create the original Lizzy and Jane
line-art portraits from user-directed visual references. The generated
portraits were reviewed and refined for use in the interface.
